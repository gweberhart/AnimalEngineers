		<b>Mission Statement</b><br>
	<p>Nevada Greyhounds Unlimited is a local non-profit organization
		dedicated to finding loving permanent homes for ex-racing greyhounds.
		We do not have our own kennel, but work with several other rescue
		groups that bring the greyhounds off the track and prepare them for
		adoption. We talk to prospective adopters, take in applications,
		conduct home visits, and then process applications through the
		adoption agencies that we work with. Most of the greyhounds we place
		are from the Caliente racetrack in Tijuana, Mexico or from Phoenix,
		Arizona.
	<p>We sponsor many events throughout the year that serve both to
		educate the public and to help us meet people who are interested in
		adopting greyhounds. We welcome volunteers, with or without
		greyhounds. There are no membership fees for joining our organization.
	<p>We have many wonderful volunteers that help us with everything
		from writing our newsletter to helping us with all our Meet N Greets
		and social functions. Many of our greyhounds are trained as Pet
		Therapy dogs and we even have a couple of them that are certified as
		Service Dogs.
	<p>We would like to extend a special welcome to greyhound owners
		who are new to Northern Nevada, and we invite you to come by and meet
		us at our next event.
	<p>Contact any of the following NGU volunteers for more
