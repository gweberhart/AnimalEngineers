		<b>Frequently Asked Questions</b><br>
	<ul>
		<li>Are the greyhounds housebroken?
			<p>Frequently an adopted greyhound is completely housebroken
				right from the start. Greyhounds are kennel trained. This means that
				they are taught not to soil their own space. At the track,
				greyhounds are taken outside three or four times a day to relieve
				themselves. There may be an accident or two, but this is best
				avoided by taking your greyhound out frequently and giving it lots
				of praise when it finds the right spot.
		<li>Can they be kept outdoors?
			<p>NO! Greyhounds need to be indoor pets. Because of their thin
				coats and lack of body fat, they cannot stand temperature extremes.
				They can’t tolerate all day in the garage, either -- especially in
				the summer. Some folks who are gone all day install a dog door,
				which allow their greyhound to come inside when he gets too hot or
				cold during the day. Nevada Greyhounds Unlimited requires every
				adopter to commit to keeping his or her greyhound as an indoor dog.





			
		<li>What kind of personalities do greyhounds have?
			<p>Greyhounds are very intelligent, adaptable dogs who fit easily
				into their new environment, following a brief adjustment period.
				They are eager to please and respond well to any love and attention
				that is given to them. Most greyhounds are clean, quiet, gentle,
				good-natured dogs that adapt and get along well with other animals
				and children.
		<li>How old are the greyhounds when they are put up for adoption?
			<p>They are anywhere between the ages of two to five years old.
				The younger dogs may not have qualified for racing. Most of the
				older dogs were retired from racing because they were no longer
				competitive. We also place dogs from local animal shelters or from
				families who can no longer keep their dog. Retired greyhounds enjoy
				many years of good health. With proper care, they have a life
				expectancy of twelve to fourteen years.
		<li>How large are greyhounds?
			<p>Greyhound males stand 26 to 30 inches tall at the shoulder and
				weight between 65 and 85 lbs. Females stand 23 to 26 inches tall at
				the shoulder and weight 50 to 65 lbs. They come in many colors and
				shapes. Racing greyhounds are bred for speed and not for
				conformation of any kind.
		<li>How much exercise do greyhounds need?
			<p>Greyhounds are the fastest breed of dog in the world, but they
				are sprinters without a lot of endurance. A retired racer is quite
				content to be a “couch potato” and spend most of the day sleeping.
				Exercising your greyhound with walks and occasional chances to run
				around in a completely fenced area are all that is required, but you
				can never let your greyhound out of a fenced area or off its leash.
				These dogs have been trained to run and chase things since they were
				puppies, and they will continue to do this no matter how much you
				yell or how much obedience training they have had. Also, because
				they have been raised in a sheltered environment at the track,
				greyhounds have no street smarts. Let loose, they are sure to get
				hit by a car or become lost very quickly.
		<li>Do greyhounds shed?
			<p>Yes, but less than most dogs. Their coats are short and sleek,
				and they don’t smell doggy. They are easy to maintain with a quick
				brushing once a week. They also don’t have the same dander as most
				dogs, so many people who are allergic to other dogs can often live
				with greyhounds.
		<li>Are greyhounds good with children?
			<p>More so than most breeds. They are not as playful as puppies,
				since they are mature dogs, but they are very tolerant of children
				and will usually walk away rather than growl or snap at an
				overbearing child. But, like any dogs, they have their limits, and
				children must be taught to respect those limits.
		<li>Are greyhounds good with other pets?
			<p>Greyhounds are friendly by nature and socialize well because
				of their experiences with other greyhounds in the racing kennel.
				Greyhounds have never been exposed to other breeds of dogs. They
				know other greyhounds but may be perplexed, frightened, or simply
				ignore other breeds, but most greyhounds learn quickly to get along
				with other breeds of dogs. Most learn to accept cats and are
				cat-tested before being place into your home.
		<li>What do greyhounds eat?
			<p>During their racing careers, greyhounds are fed a high-energy
				diet to help them perform at their peak. However, retired racers
				need only high-quality dry dog food with a protein content of 20 to
				26 percent to provide nutrition and to prevent weight gain. They are
				used to being fed twice a day, so it is not a good idea to free-feed
				your greyhound.
		<li>Do greyhounds have special medical needs?
			<p>Greyhounds don’t require any special veterinary care.
				Greyhounds are the only large breed of dog not plagued by hip
				dysplasia. They are sensitive to barbiturates and some flea
				medications.
