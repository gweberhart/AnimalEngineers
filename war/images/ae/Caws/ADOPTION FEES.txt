ADOPTION FEES: Many people decide to go through rescue because they have "always wanted" a Bulldog and they think by going through us they can get a Bulldog cheaper then the expensive puppies for sale. Bulldogs are not cheap to adopt, the fee can range from $300 to $700 depending on the dogs age and health. Adopting is less expensive then buying a puppy but in the long run can get expensive because the dog may have issues either mental or physical that needs dealing with through training or even on going medical needs. We are selective on where the dogs are placed and into what homes they go, we want people to adopt our dogs for the right reasons and to have done research on the breed itself. Just having "always wanted one" is not always good enough, having a love of dogs and understanding this breed can be different is what we look for. They are indoor dogs, need to be one of the family, need to see a vet for check ups regularly, and they need to be given unconditional love, as that's what they will give you. Please don't come looking for a "Cheap" Bulldog from us.
