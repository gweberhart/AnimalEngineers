<b>Mission Statement</b>Nevada Greyhounds Unlimited Nevada Greyhounds
	Unlimited is a local non-profit organization dedicated to finding
	loving permanent homes for ex-racing greyhounds. We do not have our own
	kennel, but work with several other rescue groups that bring the
	greyhounds off the track and prepare them for adoption. We talk to
	prospective adopters, take in applications, conduct home visits, and
	then process applications through the adoption agencies that we work
	with. Most of the greyhounds we place are from the Caliente racetrack
	in Tijuana, Mexico or from Phoenix, Arizona. We sponsor many events
	throughout the year that serve both to educate the public and to help
	us meet people who are interested in adopting greyhounds. We welcome
	volunteers, with or without greyhounds. There are no membership fees
	for joining our organization. We would like to extend a special welcome
	to greyhound owners who are new to Northern Nevada, and we invite you
	to come by and meet us at our next event. Contact any of the following
	NGU volunteers for more information: Gay Johnson Silver Springs, NV

	puppy. Terry is a Meet and Greet volunteer and is also a foster home
	for greyhounds awaiting adoption. Patti O'Neil Reno, NV
	Gr8thound@aol.com Patti has many critters on her property, including
	both greyhounds and cats. Patti’s home is the “cat safe” testing ground
	before a greyhound is placed in a home with cats. Peggy Pollyea Minden,
	NV 775-267-2128 ppollyea@charter.net Peggy has a beautiful fawn girl
	named Janie. Janie lives happily with a cat and gets along well with
	her Lhasa Apso and Shih-Tzu cousins. Peggy is a placement
	representative for Carson City, Minden, and Gardnerville. Dave & Karen
	Vigil Reno, NV nguwebmaster@charter.net Karen, Dave, and Amy Vigil were
	NGU’s first adopters when they started placing greyhounds in 1995. They
	said they would take any color greyhound except black, but guess what?
	They adopted a beautiful black male, who they renamed Scooter. (Many
	adopters give their dogs new names to go along with a new start in
	life, and the dogs seem to adapt quickly.) The Vigils have been
	volunteers since NGU first started doing Meet and Greets. They have
	also served as a foster home and helped with transporting. Jan Pantone
	Reno, NV jlpantone@sbcglobal.net Jan has been involved with NGU since
	someone gave her the gift of a greyhound from the Florida track in
	2002. Her sweet little brindle named Honey passed away recently but was
	the light of Jan's life for many years. Nancy Foster
	greytlove@sbcglobal.net Del Roehrick del.roehrick@sbcglobal.net Nancy
	Foster and Del Roehrick. They are volunteers that run the Meet N Greets
	at Petco in Reno. They have three greyhounds, Mac, Honey and Jazzmin.
	They have been hooked on greyhounds since they adopted their first,
	Honey in 2003. They live in Reno and are also involved in transporting
	and fostering. Debbie & Rich Kane jairedale@charter.net Debbie and Rich
	Kane have been with NGU for many years, can't remember how long. Deb
	contacted us shortly after acquiring her greyhound Sky from her
	daughter who had adopted her from the track in Portland, OR. Sky is now
	at the Rainbow Bridge with so many of our greyhounds. In 2003 Deb and
	Rich offered to foster a greyhound that was being returned, they soon
	fell in love and flunked fostering by adopting Nevada. He is now called
	Atticus and is in his forever home. Deb and Rich are very involved and
	volunteer for just about everything from Meet N Greets to transporting.
	They supply the trailer we use in the parades and are always there to
	help with setting up and breaking down the Meet N Greet booths. They
	live in Gardnerville and are always happy to answer any questions about
	greyhounds. Atticus is a certified Service Dog and also trained in Pet
	Therapy.
