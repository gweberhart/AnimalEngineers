		<b>Mission Statement</b><br>
	<p>The mission of the Northern Nevada Bulldog Rescue is to take in
		homeless and surrendered Bulldogs and provide them with care and
		housing until a forever home can be found. We will strive to do what
		it takes to educate prospective owners about this wonderful breed and
		help them understand bulldogs and their needs.
	<p>
		<b>GOAL</b> Our goal is to never turn away a Bulldog needing a home
		and to never judge an owner for turning in their dog. Through a
		thorough screening process we will strive to find a stable, loving
		home for the dogs and help the adoption go smoothly for both the new
		family and the Bulldog. We will only place dogs that are spayed or
		neutered (unless medical issues prevent us from doing so) as one of
		our primary concerns is to reduce the risk of more homeless dogs
		through improper or accidental breeding.
	<p>
		<b>SURRENDERING A BULLDOG </b> We are well aware that life changes
		happen and many times the family pets are effected. We also know how
		hard it is too give up your dog as they are part of your family. We
		are not here to judge so please be as honest with us as we are with
		you. We need to know if your dog has physical or physiological issues
		as this will help us in the rehabilitation and placement of the dog.
		Unless your dog has severely bitten someone, we will find him/her an
		appropriate, loving home.
